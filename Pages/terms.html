            information. If you are a doctor or medical student, your personal information may be included to the akmg
            global's physician database or Directory, which is kept confidential, in addition to the disclosures
            mentioned above. A visitor's personally identifying information is not collected by online adverts on the
            akmg global website. Aggregate non-medical data on visitors, such as the day of the week and the type of web
            browser, may be gathered by akmg global. To evaluate the success of their advertising, such information can
            be disclosed to advertisers. Minors under the age of 13 We do not knowingly market to or collect data from
            children under the age of 13 online. How we protect information: As an additional security measure to
            further safeguard your information, some portions of the site require the use of a user ID and password. By
            doing so, akmg global is able to confirm your identity, giving you access to your account information while
            preventing unauthorized access. Always click the "Log Out" option that appears on every secure page after
            you have done using a secure section of the akmg global website. You must enter your user ID and password
            again in order to make any additional secure transactions. Sadly, there is no way to guarantee that data
            transfer over the Internet is 100 percent safe.
